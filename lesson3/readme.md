 - No <table>s please
 - The items colored in cyan (?) are supposed to be headings (besides the footer of course)
 - The scratch area is supposed to be text
 - The items numbered (1),(2),(3),(4) should be links and should have a specific style while the mouse is over the element (CSS only styling)
 - HTML5 audio/video (_doesn't matter what its playing as long as it plays something_)
 
Bonus points:
 - Create a CSS media query which gives a good view on the mobile phone
 
Rules:
 - No server side code
 - Use HTML5 elements

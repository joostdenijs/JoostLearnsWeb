Build a website featuring your favorite polka band Alpen Oberkrainer (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGw5OwTNO2w).

Here are rules:

1.       Show a list of tour dates (location, venue, date) (you can make them up)
2.       The site must feature a fixed sidebar menu (doesn't scroll with page)
3.       The site must feature a fixed full width header (doesn't scroll with page)
4.       Add HTML5 audio and/or video
5.       Has to work *exactly* the same in both IE and Chrome

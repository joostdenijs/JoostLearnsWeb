        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Joost de Nijs.  I was born in the Netherlands, grew up in Virginia, went to college in Rhode Island, and now live outside Seattle, WA.
            I work at Microsoft as a Program Manager on the ASP.NET Web Tools and Framework team building web developer tooling for Visual Studio.
            Outside of work I enjoy hanging out with my girlfriend Eva and my dog Bonzai, playing music (guitar and piano), 
            and volunteering with Destination Imagination as a Regional Challenge Master.

            The VENLab is a research facility designed to study problems related to perception and action, 
            with an emphasis on the visual control of locomotion and navigation. 
            This work has a wide range of applications including robotics, computer animation, architecture and the design of navigation tools like GPS.
        </p>

        <p>
            I first joined the VENLab in the Spring of my Freshman year at Brown as a Research Assistant. 
            Initially, my role was concentrated on helping run participants through studies conducted in virtual reality,
            however, I soon began to take a role in the coding and development of the VR experiments becoming the lab's first in-house developer.
            Over the next five years I oversaw the expansion of the dev team to four people, as we built two seperate frameworks
            (one for each of the research focus areas of the lab, Navigation and Locomotion).

            Before working at either Microsoft or as a Developer at the VENLab, I had several other jobs during high school and early college.
            While none of them would make the cut for my printed CV, I've included them here as a personal reminder of the professional path I've traversed.

                My role in the project revolved around collecting small arms data for both Latin American and post-Communist countries under the direction of Professor Aaron Karp.
                In the process I also worked to improve the algortims for extrapolting the total small arms stockpiles for these countries,
                through refinement of the parameters regarding military foce size and size/scope of active military conflicts.

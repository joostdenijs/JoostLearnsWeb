            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Joost de Nijs.  I was born in the Netherlands, grew up in Virginia, went to college in Rhode Island, and now live outside Seattle, WA.
            I work at Microsoft as a Program Manager on the ASP.NET Web Tools and Framework team building web developer tooling for Visual Studio.
            Outside of work I enjoy hanging out with my girlfriend Eva and my dog Bonzai, playing music (guitar and piano), 
            and volunteering with Destination Imagination as a Regional Challenge Master.

            The VENLab is a research facility designed to study problems related to perception and action, 
            with an emphasis on the visual control of locomotion and navigation. 
            This work has a wide range of applications including robotics, computer animation, architecture and the design of navigation tools like GPS.
        </p>

        <p>
            I first joined the VENLab in the Spring of my Freshman year at Brown as a Research Assistant. 
            Initially, my role was concentrated on helping run participants through studies conducted in virtual reality,
            however, I soon began to take a role in the coding and development of the VR experiments becoming the lab's first in-house developer.
            Over the next five years I oversaw the expansion of the dev team to four people, as we built two seperate frameworks
            (one for each of the research focus areas of the lab, Navigation and Locomotion).

            Before working at either Microsoft or as a Developer at the VENLab, I had several other jobs during high school and early college.
            While none of them would make the cut for my printed CV, I've included them here as a personal reminder of the professional path I've traversed.

            After finishing my undergraduate degree, I decided to take advantage of Brown's 5th year master program in Computer Science.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>My graduate coursework focused on Programming Languages, Machine Translation and Cloud Computing.</li>
            <li>I also served as the Head TA for a course on Cybersecurity and International Relations.  
                As this was the first time that course was offered, I was able to play a role in shaping the curriculum and coursework.
            </li>

            my coursework and studies were focused entirely on Math, Computer Science and Political Science.
            My
            <abbr title="Brown's term for majors">concentrations</abbr>
            were in Political Science with a focus on
